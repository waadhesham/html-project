        <h1>C++</h1>
        The C++ language has two main components:
        a direct mapping of hardware features provided 
        primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead
        abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup
        describes C++ as a light-weight abstraction
        programming language [designed] for building
        and using efficient and elegant abstractions;
        offering both hardware access and abstraction is
        the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what 
        distinguishes it from other languages.

<b>Object storage</b>
</br>
As in C, C++ supports four types of memory management: static
 storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, 
automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.

    <p>C++ introduces object-oriented
        programming (OOP) features to C. It offers
         classes, which provide the four features 
       commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages
       : abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared
         to classes in other programming languages is support
        for deterministic destructors, which in turn
         provide support for the Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) concept
