        <h1>HTML</h1>
        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
         It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
          (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
         storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML 
         describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
          included cues for the appearance of the document.
        
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
         constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
         may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to 
         create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
          text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other
           items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle 
           brackets. Tags such as (img ) and (input ) directly introduce
            content into the page. Other tags such as (P) surround and provide
                 information about document text and may include other tags as 
                 sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use
                  them to interpret the content of the page.
        
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as 
        JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
            Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World 

        Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
         maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over 
         explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

<b>Data types</b>
</br>

HTML defines several data types for
 element content, such as script data and stylesheet data,
  and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, 
  names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, 
  colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on.
 All of these data types are specializations of character data.

    <li><b>Delivery</b></li>

    <p>
        HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file.
         However, they are most 
        often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.
