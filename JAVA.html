        <h1>Java</h1>
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
         that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
         It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
         developers write once, run anywhere
         (WORA),[16] meaning that
          compiled Java code can run 
          on all platforms that support
           Java without the need for recompilation.[17]
            Java applications are typically compiled to 
            bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
             (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
              The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
               low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime
                provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime
                 code modification) that are typically not available in traditional 
                 compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
                 programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly
                  for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
                  

        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
         (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as
          a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original
           and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and 
           class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
            As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community
             Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General 
             
             ublic License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the 
             official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source 
             software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux
             distributions.
        
        As of March 2021, the latest version is Java 16, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.
        
        Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.[21] Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 16) or an LTS release.

<b>Object storage</b>
</br>
As in C, C++ supports four types of memory management: static
 storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, 
automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.

<>
    <li><b>Principles</b></li>

    
<li>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</li>        
        
<li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>

<li>It must be robust and secure. </li>

<li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
        
<li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
        
<li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">reed more..</a></li>
