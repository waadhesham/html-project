	<h1 >Programming Languages </h1>
	
<h2 >What are the programming languages?</h2>
	<p>A programming language is a formal language 
        comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine
         code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language,
          and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

     <p>   Most programming languages consist of instructions
         for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set
          of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.
           Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior
            of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos The programs for these machines 
             did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</p>
        
     <p>Thousands of different programming languages have
         been created, and more are being created every year. 
         Many programming 
         languages are written in an imperative form while other languages use the declarative form .
        
        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of 
        syntax  and semantics. Some languages are defined by a specification document
          while other languages 
         have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages
         have both, with the basic language 
        defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>
